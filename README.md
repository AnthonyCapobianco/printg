# printg (alpha 0.0.1)

This program is designed to provide an easy way for users to graphically display a point on a graph. 

This is a work-in-project and a proof of concept. 

I know this probably has been done before, probably better. 

Just like for the well known printf, this is just the surface of the iceberg, there are more functions to come which will allow to:

* Show multiple points on a graph.
* Name points 
* Change the scale of the x and y axis
* Link multiple points to make a "shape"
